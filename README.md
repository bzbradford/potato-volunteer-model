## Potato volunteer survival risk tool

Potato volunteers are tubers left in the field after harvest which may survive the winter and grow during the following season. These plants increase the risk of late blight because they may not appear in current-season potato fields and so will not receive preventive fungicide applicatons.

A model was developed at [Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/potential_survival_of_potato_volunteers_in_mich) which predicted a high risk of volunteer survival when 2- and 4-inch soil temperatures did not fall below 27Â°F for more than 120 hours during the winter, moderate risk when only 2-inch soil temperatures achieved threshold, and low risk when both depths reached threshold.
